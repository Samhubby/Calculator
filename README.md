# Calculator

I created this calculator using HTML, JavaScript, and the Tailwind CSS framework. 
It is important to note that there are no Tailwind CSS files included in the project. 
The code for this calculator is stored in the "master" branch of the repository. 
This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
It also includes functionalities like clearing the input, changing the sign of numbers, and calculating percentages.
